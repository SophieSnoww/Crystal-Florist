# The Prismatic Garden

## Rules
1. No derogatory language or slurs. swearing is fine, but if it gets excessive you may be warned.
2. Homophobia, transphobia, acephobia, racism, sexism, or other hateful behavior are all bannable offences.
3. No spam or generally excessive messages.
4. Generally just be nice. if someone asks you to stop doing something, stop, or bring it up with a moderator.

## Guidelines
1. Discussions shouldnt be person vs person, they should be people vs problem.
2. Politics, in general, are thin ice. its hard to talk about politics without arguing, and thats what we want to avoid.
3. Avoid being passive-aggressive. this most likely wont get you banned, but just be honest with each other.
4. Let people enjoy things. being critical of something someone likes just makes them feel bad, and makes them less willing to share their cool interests in the future.
